# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `#1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of the survey is to analyze specific factors contributing to the high turnover of employees in entry- and lower-level positions at our company. By gathering detailed feedback on aspects such as work-life balance, compensation, career advancement opportunities, and management practices, the HR department aims to identify key areas impacting employee satisfaction and retention. The insights gained from this survey will be used to develop targeted strategies to enhance the work environment, improve employee engagement, and ultimately reduce turnover rates.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: All employees in entry- and lower-level positions at the tech company.

Sampling Frame: The companyâ€™s employee directory, filtered to include only employees in entry- and lower-level roles.

Sampling Units: Each individual employee in these roles.

Observational units: Employees that complete the survey

Sampling Strategy: Stratified random sampling could be effective here to ensure representation across various departments. This will capture diverse perspectives on satisfaction, which might vary by department. If departments are small, a simple random sample might work to get a representative snapshot without department-level breakdowns.
```

```
1. How long have you been employed at the company? (Options: Less than 6 months, 6 months to 1 year, 1-2 years, 2+ years)
